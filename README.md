## Uno Game Lab
A simple ***work in progress*** Uno game in Java played through the terminal (ANSI color recommended for best experience).

The rules may not be perfect, but it should at leat be good enough for now.

I will update the README.md as the project draws to a close.

#### Development Status (Hopefully I will keep updating this)
- [x] Card, Hand and Deck Class Functionality
- [x] Basic TUI Functionality (Colors and Boxes)
- [x] Player and Basic Bot Functionality
- [x] Game Logic
- [x] Game Ending Logic and such
- [x] Main Game Loop
- [x] TUI Stuff (Main Menu possibly, and actually print useful stuff that is relevant to the game)
- [x] Bug fixing (hopefully bug free)
