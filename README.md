## Uno Game Lab
A simple ***work in progress*** Uno game in Java played through the terminal (ANSI color reccomended for best experience).

The rules may perhaps not be perfect, but it should at leat be good enough for now.

I will update the README.md as the project draws to a close.

#### Development Status (Hopefully I will keep updating this)
- [x] Card, Hand and Deck Class Functionality
- [x] Basic TUI Functionality (Colors and Boxes)
- [x] Player and Basic Bot Functionality
- [ ] Game Logic
- [ ] Main Game Loop
- [ ] TUI Stuff (Main Menu possibly, and actually print useful stuff that is relevant to the game)
- [ ] Maybe make an improved bot?? (Or a random one for fun)
- [ ] Bug fixing
